# Projects
- Hello, I am Kunal Ghaware, comleted my Bachelors in Information Technology and my post-degree certification course in Data Analytics for Business.
- In this repository I have created few projects that are related to my feild of study(Data Analytics and Data Scientist).
- Few of the projects that I have created are as follows:-
1. Data Visualization for Netflix dataset using SQL and Tableau - In this project, I have used SQL for cleaning and for statistical analysis of the dataset and passed the cleaned dataset to Tableau for visualization.
2. Covid Tweet Prediction using NLP - Here I have trained a model for classifying the covid tweet into positive, neutral and negative using the NLP techniques.
3. Feature Extraction alongside Data visualization - As we know that training the model with relevent features can increase the accuracy and precision of the model. So in this project I have performed different methods of feature extraction alone with data visualization so that we can see the difference between the model which was trained using the important features only vs the model which was trained using all the available features.
5. Data Visualization using PowerBI - In this project, I have worked arounf with amazon's sales dataset. I have imported the data into powerBI and then cleaned and trasformed the data using PowerQuery and loaded the cleaned data into powerBI framework for analysis. 
6. Money Expense - In this project I used my Java Skills for making a demo dashboard for your money expense and export it to excel sheet. In this I used CRUD Operation and created workspaces for different types of expenses.
